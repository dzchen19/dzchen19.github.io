I am Dingzhi Chen, a PhD in Economics at the University of Southampton. Supervised by Professor Jackie Wahba and Professor Corrado Giulietti. My research focuses on migration and health, examining how migration experiences influence the well-being of migrants and their children. Using large-scale panel data and applied microeconometric methods, I study health dynamics and the mechanisms underlying health inequalities among migrant families.
I am on the 2025-2026 job market.
