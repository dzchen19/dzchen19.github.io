### **4. When the Air Gets Dirty: Recruitment Responses in China’s Listed Companies**
*With Yu Qin and Hanlei Huang--Working Paper*

This paper examines how air pollution shapes firms’ recruitment strategies in China. Using a CES framework and a panel of over seven million online job postings, we find that higher pollution leads firms to lower advertised wages for managerial roles while expanding hiring for non-managerial positions. Instrumental variable estimates using exogenous pollution shocks confirm causality, showing that environmental stress reshapes labour demand and pay structures.
