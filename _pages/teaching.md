## Teaching Overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
During my PhD at the University of Southampton, I worked as a Teaching Assistant for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in Economics.  My teaching covered topics such as macroeconomics, econometrics, and data analysis.  I independently designed and delivered seminar materials, combining theoretical explanations with applied problem-solving.  I also contributed to coursework marking, final exam grading, and provided detailed feedback to students.  In addition, I supervised dissertation projects and offered one-to-one academic support on research design, quantitative methods, and academic writing.  These experiences have strengthened my ability to communicate complex economic concepts clearly and to support students with diverse academic backgrounds.
